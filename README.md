# Compilers Project

## Overview

This Java project covers essential compiler design tasks, providing tools for converting regular expressions to NFAs, NFAs to DFAs, calculating CFG First and Follow sets, and performing left recursion and epsilon elimination. Additionally, it includes an LL(1) parser.

## Features

- **RegEx to NFA**: Convert regular expressions to Non-deterministic Finite Automata.
- **NFA to DFA**: Transform NFAs into Deterministic Finite Automata.
- **CFG First and Follow**: Compute First and Follow sets for Context-Free Grammars.
- **Left Recursion Elimination**: Remove left recursion from grammars.
- **Epsilon Elimination**: Eliminate epsilon (empty) productions from grammars.
- **LL(1) Parser**: Implement an LL(1) parser for parsing context-free languages.

## Installation
